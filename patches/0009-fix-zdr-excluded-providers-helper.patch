Subject: [PATCH] Fix ZDR excluded providers helper placement

This patch fixes the ZDR excluded providers helper so it lives on the Pipe
class and is available to model filtering and catalog sync logic.

Highlights:
- Adds Pipe._zdr_excluded_provider_set and related helpers.
- Unblocks model filtering, catalog sync, and request handling in tests.

To apply: git apply patches/0009-fix-zdr-excluded-providers-helper.patch
To revert: git apply -R patches/0009-fix-zdr-excluded-providers-helper.patch

Note: This patch modifies existing upstream files. When upstream updates these
files, you may need to resolve merge conflicts.
