# OpenRouter Direct Uploads (bypass Open WebUI RAG for chat uploads)

Open WebUI supports uploading files into a chat. By default, Open WebUI often treats those uploads as **RAG / Knowledge** inputs (extracting text, embedding, retrieving, etc.).

The **OpenRouter Direct Uploads** integration is a toggleable Open WebUI *filter* that can instead forward eligible chat uploads to OpenRouter as **direct multimodal inputs** (files/audio/video), bypassing Open WebUI RAG for those uploads.

This is useful when:
- You want the **model** to directly “see” the uploaded content (PDFs for native document understanding, audio/video understanding, etc.).
- You do **not** want Open WebUI to embed or chunk the upload.
- You want per-chat control (single toggle) and per-user modality control (simple valves).

> **Scope note:** this filter applies to **chat uploads** (`files[]` in the Open WebUI request payload).  
> Image understanding is handled by the pipe’s normal multimodal intake (`image_url` → `input_image`). See: [Multimodal Ingestion Pipeline](multimodal_ingestion_pipeline.md).

## Quick start

### Admin (recommended defaults)
- Keep `AUTO_INSTALL_DIRECT_UPLOADS_FILTER=true` so the pipe installs/updates the companion filter in Open WebUI’s Functions DB.
- Keep `AUTO_ATTACH_DIRECT_UPLOADS_FILTER=true` so the toggle appears only on models where direct files/audio/video are supported.
- Configure the filter’s **admin valves** (size limits and allowlists) to match your environment and risk tolerance.

### User (per chat)
1. Enable the **Direct Uploads** toggle in the Integrations menu.

2. In the filter settings (“knobs”), enable one or more modality valves:
   - `DIRECT_FILES`
   - `DIRECT_AUDIO`
   - `DIRECT_VIDEO`
3. Upload supported files in the chat as usual.

---

## UI surfaces (where toggles/valves live)

There are **two layers** of control:

1) **Integrations menu switch (per chat)**  
   - Single on/off toggle: **Direct Uploads**

2) **User valves (per user; edited via filter settings)**  
   - `DIRECT_FILES`
   - `DIRECT_AUDIO`
   - `DIRECT_VIDEO`

Admins configure size limits and allowlists via the filter’s **admin valves** (see below).

---

## What gets diverted (and what does not)

When the filter is enabled and a user turns on one or more modality valves:

- **Diverted** (direct upload path):
  - Uploads that match the relevant **MIME allowlist** and **size limits**
  - Audio/video uploads only when their MIME/format matches the filter’s allowlists

- **Not diverted** (normal Open WebUI path, fail-open):
  - Uploads not allowlisted (example: `.docx`, `.xlsx` when your allowlist is only PDF/text)
  - Knowledge-base style uploads marked `legacy: true`
  - Anything missing an Open WebUI file `id`

Fail-open is intentional: unsupported types should continue to behave like “normal Open WebUI” (RAG/Knowledge) rather than breaking chat uploads.

---

## Model compatibility (how we detect “supports files/audio/video”)

This integration does **not** rely on Open WebUI’s `file_upload` capability flag (deployments often enable `file_upload` broadly for UI reasons).

Instead, the pipe maintains an internal capability map in each model’s metadata:

- `model.info.meta.openrouter_pipe.capabilities.file_input`
- `model.info.meta.openrouter_pipe.capabilities.audio_input`
- `model.info.meta.openrouter_pipe.capabilities.video_input`

These are derived from the OpenRouter model catalog and are used for:
- Deciding whether to auto-attach the filter (`AUTO_ATTACH_DIRECT_UPLOADS_FILTER`)
- Validating user toggles at runtime

---

## Data flow (filter → metadata marker → pipe injection)

### 1) Filter diversion (inlet)

When the filter diverts an upload, it:
- Removes the diverted items from the request `files[]` list **and** from `metadata.files`, so Open WebUI won’t treat them as knowledge inputs.
- Records lightweight references (file IDs + hints) under:
  - `__metadata__["openrouter_pipe"]["direct_uploads"]`

### Interaction with Open WebUI “File Context” (OWUI 0.7.x+)

Open WebUI has a per-model capability toggle called **File Context** (Models → Advanced Settings → Capabilities). When enabled, Open WebUI will:
- Extract content from uploaded files / knowledge items
- Run retrieval as needed
- Inject the resulting context into the conversation (prompt) before the request reaches the model provider

This is great for classic OWUI RAG flows, but it is the opposite of what “Direct Uploads” is for: Direct Uploads is meant to forward the original file bytes to OpenRouter as **real multimodal inputs** (documents/audio/video), without OWUI pre-extracting and injecting text.

#### The important implementation detail (why we touch both `files[]` and `metadata.files`)

In OWUI, the File Context handler reads **`metadata.files`** (not `files[]`) when deciding what to process for injection. However, OWUI also rebuilds `metadata.files` from the request `files[]` after inlet filters have run.

That means: if a diversion filter only edits `metadata.files`, OWUI can later overwrite it from the unmodified `files[]`, and the File Context injector may still run on the diverted uploads.

To make Direct Uploads behave consistently, the companion filter therefore:
- Removes diverted items from **both** `files[]` and `metadata.files`
- Leaves **retained** (non-diverted) items in place so OWUI can still handle them normally

#### What you should expect (behavior matrix)

- **Direct Uploads OFF**
  - **File Context ON** → OWUI may extract/retrieve and inject file context into messages (classic OWUI RAG behavior).
  - **File Context OFF** → OWUI skips automatic file extraction/injection; only raw attachment metadata remains.

- **Direct Uploads ON**
  - Diverted uploads are removed from `files[]`/`metadata.files`, so OWUI File Context will not inject their extracted content (even if File Context is enabled for the model).
  - Diverted uploads are forwarded to OpenRouter as direct inputs by the pipe (see next sections).
  - Any non-diverted uploads (unsupported type, allowlist mismatch, user valve off, etc.) remain on the normal OWUI path and may still be processed by File Context when enabled.

### 2) Pipe injection (main chat request only)

The pipe reads those references and:
- Loads bytes from Open WebUI storage by file `id`
- Injects the attachment(s) into the **last user message** in the outgoing request

For safety/portability, OpenRouter never receives an internal Open WebUI URL. Any internal `/api/v1/files/<id>/content` reference is inlined to a `data:<mime>;base64,...` payload before sending upstream.

### 3) Tasks do not receive direct uploads

Open WebUI may run “task model” requests during chat flows (query/title/tags/follow-up generation — for example when Web Search is enabled).

To avoid expensive prompt bloat and unintended content leakage, the pipe:
- Does **not** inject direct uploads into task requests
- Still allows the subsequent **main chat** request to receive the attachments normally

---

## Endpoint selection: `/responses` vs `/chat/completions`

OpenRouter exposes multiple OpenAI-compatible endpoints. For direct uploads, the pipe selects an endpoint based on what must be sent.

### Summary rules

- **Direct files / documents**
  - On **`/responses`**, the pipe emits Responses-style `type:"input_file"` blocks.
  - On **`/chat/completions`**, the pipe emits Chat-style `type:"file"` blocks and inlines the bytes as `file.file_data` (data URL).

- **Direct video** → requires **`/chat/completions`** (current implementation)

- **Direct audio**
  - Eligible for **`/responses`** when the (sniffed) audio format is in `DIRECT_RESPONSES_AUDIO_FORMAT_ALLOWLIST` (default: `mp3,wav`)
  - Otherwise routes to **`/chat/completions`**

The pipe does not trust upstream file metadata: it re-sniffs audio containers (for example `.m4a`) and then applies `DIRECT_RESPONSES_AUDIO_FORMAT_ALLOWLIST` for routing.

### Conflict behavior (no silent degradation)

If a request includes any direct uploads that require `/chat/completions` (video, or audio formats not eligible for `/responses`), the pipe routes the whole request to `/chat/completions` and forwards direct files using `type:"file"` blocks there.

The only hard stop is when an **admin forces `/responses`** for a model but the request requires `/chat/completions`. In that case, the pipe:
- Stops the request
- Emits a templated, user-friendly error (`ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE_CONFLICT_TEMPLATE`)

---

## Limits and allowlists (admin configuration)

Direct uploads are intentionally gated. There are **two kinds** of limits:

1) **Filter valves (admin)**
   - Per-modality max size
   - Total max size across diverted attachments
   - MIME and format allowlists

2) **Pipe safety limits (admin)**
   - The pipe must inline internal Open WebUI file references into base64 data URLs
   - Inlining is bounded by the pipe valve `BASE64_MAX_SIZE_MB`

If a diverted upload exceeds limits, the request fails with a clear error instead of silently falling back.

## Valves reference

### Pipe valves (admin)

These are configured on the **pipe** function in Open WebUI (Admin → Functions → pipe → Valves).

| Valve | Default (verified) | Purpose / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTO_ATTACH_DIRECT_UPLOADS_FILTER` | `True` | Auto-enable the OpenRouter Direct Uploads filter in each compatible model’s Advanced Settings (`filterIds`), so the switch appears only where it can work. |
| `AUTO_INSTALL_DIRECT_UPLOADS_FILTER` | `True` | Auto-install / auto-update the companion filter function into Open WebUI’s Functions DB (recommended with auto-attach). |
| `BASE64_MAX_SIZE_MB` | `50` | Upper bound for inlining Open WebUI internal file URLs into base64 data URLs. |

For the full list, see: [Valves & Configuration Atlas](valves_and_configuration_atlas.md).

### Companion filter valves (admin)

These are configured on the **OpenRouter Direct Uploads** filter function (Admin → Functions → filter → Valves).

| Valve | Default (verified) | Purpose / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIRECT_TOTAL_PAYLOAD_MAX_MB` | `50` | Maximum total size (MB) across all diverted direct uploads in a single request. |
| `DIRECT_FILE_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` | `50` | Maximum size (MB) for a single diverted direct file upload. |
| `DIRECT_AUDIO_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` | `25` | Maximum size (MB) for a single diverted direct audio upload. |
| `DIRECT_VIDEO_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` | `20` | Maximum size (MB) for a single diverted direct video upload. |
| `DIRECT_FILE_MIME_ALLOWLIST` | `application/pdf,text/plain,text/markdown,application/json,text/csv` | Comma-separated MIME allowlist for diverted direct generic files. Non-allowlisted types are fail-open (left on normal OWUI RAG/Knowledge path). |
| `DIRECT_AUDIO_MIME_ALLOWLIST` | `audio/*` | Comma-separated MIME allowlist for diverted direct audio files. |
| `DIRECT_VIDEO_MIME_ALLOWLIST` | `video/mp4,video/mpeg,video/quicktime,video/webm` | Comma-separated MIME allowlist for diverted direct video files. |
| `DIRECT_AUDIO_FORMAT_ALLOWLIST` | `wav,mp3,aiff,aac,ogg,flac,m4a,pcm16,pcm24` | Comma-separated audio format allowlist (derived from filename/MIME and/or sniffed container). |
| `DIRECT_RESPONSES_AUDIO_FORMAT_ALLOWLIST` | `wav,mp3` | Comma-separated audio formats eligible for `/responses` `input_audio.format`. |

### Companion filter user valves (per-user)

These appear in the filter’s user-facing “knobs” UI and control what gets diverted natively.

| Valve | Default (verified) | Purpose / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIRECT_FILES` | `False` | Divert eligible chat file uploads and forward them as direct document inputs. |
| `DIRECT_AUDIO` | `False` | Divert eligible audio uploads and forward them as direct audio inputs. |
| `DIRECT_VIDEO` | `False` | Divert eligible video uploads and forward them as direct video inputs (routes via `/chat/completions`). |

## Troubleshooting

### “Direct Upload Issue” error

This is emitted by the pipe (not OpenRouter) when direct uploads can’t be applied safely.

Common causes:
- File exceeds size limits
- MIME type is not allowlisted (or the model/provider rejects it)
- Open WebUI storage object could not be loaded by ID
- Admin enforced an incompatible endpoint override (forced `/responses` but the request requires `/chat/completions`)

### “Provider says unsupported MIME/type”

This comes from the upstream provider/model. Even if your allowlist permits a type, a specific provider may reject it.

Best practice:
- Keep allowlists conservative (PDF + plain text is a good starting point for “documents”).
- Let non-allowlisted types fall back to normal Open WebUI RAG/Knowledge behavior.

### “Where did my upload go?”

If you enable direct uploads and your upload disappears from the RAG/Knowledge path, that is expected:
- The filter removes diverted items from `files[]` so Open WebUI doesn’t treat them as knowledge inputs.
- The pipe injects the upload into the model request as a direct multimodal block.

If you don’t see it reaching the model:
- Confirm the filter toggle is enabled in the Integrations menu for that chat.
- Confirm the relevant user valve is enabled (Files/Audio/Video).
- Confirm the MIME type is allowlisted and the file is within size limits.

If direct uploads are enabled but the selected model does not support a required modality (file/audio/video), the filter will **fail open**:
- The upload stays on the normal Open WebUI path (RAG/Knowledge), and
- The pipe emits a warning notification that direct uploads were not applied for those attachments.

### Debug logging (useful strings)

When `OPENAI` log level is set to debug in Open WebUI, the pipe logs:
- `Injecting direct uploads into chat request ...`
- `Ignoring direct uploads for task request ...`
