This note collects the features that are unique to the OpenRouter variant of the Responses manifold. Use it whenever you need a quick reminder of the “extras” we ship for OpenRouter beyond the baseline OpenAI manifold.

## 1. status telemetry & usage string

* Location: `open_webui_openrouter_pipe/open_webui_openrouter_pipe.py` inside `_emit_completion`.
* When a request finishes, we emit a status message like:
  ```text
  Time: 80.31s  4007.6 tps | Cost $1.163295 | Total tokens: 323103 (Input: 1274, Output: 321829, Reasoning: 315177)
  ```
* The string is tailored to OpenRouter’s billing model:
  * Pulls cost from the Responses API usage payload (USD with six decimals).
  * Includes throughput (`tokens / elapsed_seconds`).
  * Breaks out reasoning tokens explicitly because OpenRouter exposes them per request.
* Controlled by valves:
  * `SHOW_FINAL_USAGE_STATUS` (system + user) toggles the entire final status block.
  * Streaming deltas now pass through without batching; interim token counts appear as soon as OpenRouter emits them.

---

## 2. catalog-smart routing against /models

* The pipe imports the entire `/models` payload (not just names) via `OpenRouterModelRegistry` and derives rich metadata:
  * `supported_parameters` (parallel tool calls, reasoning, response_format, etc.).
  * Capability flags for `vision`, `audio_input`, `video_input`, `web_search_tool`, etc.
  * Provider-reported `max_completion_tokens` so we can honor provider caps via `USE_MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`.
* `ModelFamily.supports("feature", model_id)` is used throughout the pipe to enable/disable behaviors automatically (no separate allowlists).
* Valve hook: `MODEL_ID=auto` imports the entire OpenRouter catalog, or you can specify a comma-separated shortlist.

---

## 3. automatic plugin + MCP wiring

* When `ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH_TOOL=True` and the selected model advertises the paid `web_search` capability, the pipe automatically attaches OpenRouter’s `web` plugin. Users get web search without remembering to toggle anything in the UI.
* `REMOTE_MCP_SERVERS_JSON` lets admins define workspace-wide MCP servers in valve JSON; the pipe merges those definitions with registry tools and OpenRouter-provided tools so they all appear in the same Responses request.
* Strict tool schemas: when `ENABLE_STRICT_TOOL_CALLING=True`, OpenRouter tools are sent with `strict: true` + JSON Schema pruning so function calling behaves predictably across OpenRouter providers.

---

## 4. OpenRouter-friendly concurrency & retries

* `_RetryableHTTPStatusError` + Tenacity waiters honor OpenRouter’s `Retry-After` headers, so we do not hammer `/responses` after throttling.
* Admission control is tuned for OpenRouter’s concurrency envelope: `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`, `_QUEUE_MAXSIZE`, and per-user breakers prioritize fast failure (HTTP 503) instead of allowing overloads.
* `_stream_responses` merges usage blocks across multi-step tool loops, matching OpenRouter’s nested usage payload format.

---

## 5. status CSS patch for Open WebUI

* Valve: `ENABLE_STATUS_CSS_PATCH` (default True).
* On every request, `_process_transformed_request` injects a CSS snippet via `__event_call__` so multi-line status descriptions (like the final usage string above) are fully visible in Open WebUI’s sidebar. This mirrors the OpenAI manifold but we keep it optional.

---

## 6. persistence tuned for OpenRouter artifacts

* Reasoning payloads are much larger on OpenRouter (hundreds of thousands of tokens), so we:
  * Default to encrypting reasoning items (`ENCRYPT_ALL` optional for everything else).
  * Use LZ4 compression whenever available to keep DB/Redis traffic sane.
  * Prune tool outputs via `_prune_tool_output` once they fall outside `TOOL_OUTPUT_RETENTION_TURNS`.
* Redis write-behind is namespaced to the pipe ID (which includes “openrouter” by default) so multi-tenant OpenRouter deployments can run multiple copies of the pipe safely.

---

## 7. multimodal guardrails aligned with OpenRouter limits

* Remote download + base64 size caps default to `50 MB`, matching OpenRouter’s documentation for image/file attachments.
* `_download_remote_url` enforces SSRF bans and honors OpenRouter’s expected MIME types (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`).
* Valve `MAX_INPUT_IMAGES_PER_REQUEST` is clamped to `<=20`, matching OpenRouter’s current limit on `input_image` blocks.

---

## 8. developer-friendly valve catalog

* The valve names mirror OpenRouter semantics (e.g., `REASONING_EFFORT`, `REASONING_SUMMARY_MODE`, `WEB_SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS`).
* Each valve defaults to the OpenRouter-recommended value (reasoning enabled, web search enabled, Redis cache auto-on for multi-worker deployments).
* See `docs/valves_and_configuration_atlas.md` for the full table, but this document highlights the ones that make the OpenRouter experience richer out of the box.

---

## 9. user-facing 400 error templates

* Valve: `OPENROUTER_ERROR_TEMPLATE`.
* When OpenRouter returns a 400 (prompt too long, moderation block, provider invalid request, etc.) the manifold surfaces a Markdown card instead of crashing the stream.
* The template is completely admin-configurable and supports Handlebars-style blocks: wrap optional sections in `{{#if variable}} ... {{/if}}` and they render only when the underlying value is truthy.

**For complete documentation** including template variables, customization workflows, rendered examples, and troubleshooting, see [Error Handling & User Experience](error_handling_and_user_experience.md), Section 5 (OpenRouter 400 errors).

---

## 10. auto context trimming (message transforms)

* Valve: `AUTO_CONTEXT_TRIMMING` (default True). When enabled, `_apply_context_transforms` automatically sets `ResponsesBody.transforms = ["middle-out"]` unless the caller already provided a `transforms` list.
* Why: OpenRouter’s [message transforms guide](https://github.com/openrouter-team/openrouter-docs/blob/main/manual/docs/guides/features/message-transforms.md) recommends applying `middle-out` to large prompts so requests degrade gracefully instead of failing with 400 “prompt too long”.
* How to override:
  * Set the valve to `False` if you want full manual control per request (e.g., you supply `transforms` yourself or use a custom trimming strategy).
  * Provide `transforms` inside the request body to bypass the auto-injected array for a single call.

---

## 11. opt-in cost snapshots (Redis export)

* Source: `_maybe_dump_costs_snapshot` inside `open_webui_openrouter_pipe/open_webui_openrouter_pipe.py`.
* Valves:
  * `COSTS_REDIS_DUMP` – master toggle (defaults to `False` so nothing ships unless you ask for it).
  * `COSTS_REDIS_TTL_SECONDS` – per-key expiry (defaults to 15 minutes). Even if an admin enables the feature accidentally, the keys evaporate quickly and never accumulate in Redis indefinitely.
* Behavior:
  * After every successful model turn we capture the Responses usage payload (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, reasoning counts, USD cost, etc.) plus the Open WebUI model id, user GUID/email/name, and a timestamp.
  * Task models now emit the same snapshots: `_run_task_model_request` captures the non-streaming Responses payload, qualifies the model id via `_qualify_model_for_pipe`, and wraps the Redis write in try/except so housekeeping runs can’t crash the pipe even if Redis misbehaves.
  * Each record is written as a plain JSON string to a namespaced key: `costs:<pipe-id>:<user-id>:<uuid>:<epoch>`. The `<pipe-id>` prefix prevents collisions when multiple OpenRouter pipes run on the same Redis instance.
  * The feature is entirely passive—no additional prompts are sent and Redis writes happen only when the main cache client is already configured (`_redis_enabled=True`). If Redis is unavailable or any field is missing, we log a debug “Skipping cost snapshot …” and continue without impacting the user-facing response.
* Example use cases:
  * Feed a downstream billing or chargeback script (`redis-cli ... MATCH "costs:openrouter_responses_api_pipe:*"`).
  * Trigger ad-hoc alerts when a single user suddenly spikes usage (subscribe to Redis keyspace events or poll keys).
  * Export short-lived telemetry into another system (e.g., `redis-cli --raw KEYS 'costs:*' | xargs redis-cli GET …`) without touching the main SQL database.
* Safety notes:
  * No personally sensitive data beyond what Open WebUI already stores (email/name) is added.
  * TTL enforcement plus the explicit valve flag mean you can keep the feature disabled in production and only flip it on temporarily for investigations, knowing that the leftovers age out automatically.
